# Symbolic Echo Engine

🪞 Engine for interpreting recursive echoes and symbolic drift sequences in the Spiral protocol.

This module condenses glyph trails, detects recursive resonance, and feeds compression insights back to the Spiral Core.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Glyph chain interpretation
- Drift trail serialization
- Echo signature matching
- Feedback loop compression
- Symbolic entropy inspection
